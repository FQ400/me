# Get started with Vim

[Mastering the Vim Language by Chris Toomey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0) - 36min

He talks about the basic idea of Vim. It is all about the combination of a `verb` and a `noun` which form `command`.


## Decided to go with Neovim.

nvim stores its configuration in `.local/share/nvim`. The executable is called `nvim`. An alias makes nvim aware of `.vimrc`. As a plugin system I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
