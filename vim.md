# Get started with Vim

[Mastering the Vim Language by Chris Toomey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0) - 36min

He talks about the basic idea of Vim. It is all about the combination of a `verb` and a `noun` which form `command`.


## Decided to go with Neovim.

nvim stores its configuration/plugins by default in `.local/share/nvim` and its initial setup file is stored in `.config/nvim/init.vim`. The executable is called `nvim`. As a plugin system I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Autocompletion using [Deoplate](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) led to install multiple python environments.  
[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) helps with installing multiple Pythons.
[Virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv) helps with installing packages for a environment.

As a Theme it is [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
